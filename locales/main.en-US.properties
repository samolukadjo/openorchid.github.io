location-notice="This brand is not affiliated with LibreMedia (which is certainly either a fake thing or a scam due to the donation button and having no real product), Grupo EMQSA, or their drama. They just happen to be lucky to use up all my pity and trust and then literally leak my IP address. If you are working with them. Then it's highly recommended to cut all ties and avoid them at all costs. Low people like this don't deserve any respect or rights. They will keep bothering you and then try to make you look bad. I just wanna know. What does he gain from being an asshole to developers and also being a racist, lying, poor-shaming bastard who expects to get paid for being too much of a asshole that he started talking blindly. All he gains is having a punchable face and being hated and being avoided by people who know what he did. I just can't believe I trusted an asshole whose goal is just to harm everyone…" -MortCodesWeb (Creator)
